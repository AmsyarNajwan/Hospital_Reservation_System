Hospital Reservation System

Project Overview

The Hospital Reservation System (HRS) is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the patient appointment scheduling process for healthcare facilities. Built primarily using HTML for the frontend structure and PHP for robust server-side logic and database interaction, this system replaces manual, paper-based, or telephonic booking methods with an efficient, digital platform.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of full-stack development capabilities, featuring user authentication, data management, and real-time appointment tracking. It is optimized for ease of use by both administrative staff and patients, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and patient experience.
